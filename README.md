# Auto-Web-Server

DISCLAIMER: As of now this project is in Alpha, meaning it is missing much functionality, and could be very buggy, however even in this state there may be uses for it.

An automatic web server creator that takes HTML, CSS, images, and other files to be used for downloads. This project is very in-progress and will get frequent updates as of August 13, 2020.

It is planned to be able to take one of up to three formats, Standard, where all pages are in individual directories and the main/home page is in the root directory of the app, Organized, where each file type, such as stylesheets, HTML, and images are sorted into their own directories, and Google Sites Compatable, which is designed to be plug and play with Google Takeout exports of Google Sites projects.

If you find any proplems please open an issue, thanks!
