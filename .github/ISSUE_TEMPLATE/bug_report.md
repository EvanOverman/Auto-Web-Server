**Describe the bug**
Make a detailed description of the problem, if you have the knowledge to do so, the code causing this problem's line numbers would be appreciated, but is in no way required.

**Add The Steps To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
Make a description on what would be expected if you where to go through the steps.

**Screenshots**
Screenshots would be nice, but since as of now, the program is CLI only, simply copy pasting the terminal window would be great!

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [Ubuntu, Debian, etc.] (Note, this program will only work on Debian systems, with tinkering it may work on Arch systems, but these are not supported)
 - Patch Date [Oct 25, 2020] (You can check the code, I have comments at the top for the date it was last updated)
